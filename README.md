## WebP Image Converter Readme

The WebP Image Converter is a web application that allows users to upload images, convert them to WebP format, and download the converted images. WebP is a modern image format developed by Google that offers superior compression and image quality compared to traditional formats like JPEG and PNG. The application also provides a slider feature to adjust the WebP conversion quality.

### Getting Started

To use the WebP Image Converter, you need to have a compatible web browser that supports the required features, including the WebP image format. Most modern browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari, support WebP.

### How to Use

1. Clone or download the WebP Image Converter project and set up the required environment to host the application on a web server.

2. Ensure that the required dependencies are available. The application relies on the "comparison-slider" component and the "regenerator-runtime" library.

3. Include the necessary CSS and JavaScript files in your HTML file:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/comparison-slider.css">
<script src="path/to/comparison-slider.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/regenerator-runtime/0.13.7/regenerator-runtime.min.js"></script>
<script src="path/to/webp-converter.js"></script> <!-- Replace with the actual path to your JS file -->
```

4. Add the required HTML elements to your webpage:

```html
<input type="file" id="imageUploadButton" accept="image/*" multiple>
<div class="slider-wrapper">
  <input type="range" min="0" max="100" value="90" class="slider" id="slider">
  <span class="slider-value" id="sliderValue">90</span>
</div>
<button id="downloadButtonSingle" style="display: none;">Download Single</button>
<button id="downloadButtonMultiple" style="display: none;">Download All</button>
<div id="streamline"></div>
```

5. Implement the required JavaScript code:

```javascript
// Your JavaScript code here
```

### Features

1. **Upload Images**: Users can upload multiple images at once by clicking on the "Choose File" button. Supported image formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, and others.

2. **WebP Conversion**: The application converts the uploaded images to the WebP format. Users can adjust the conversion quality using a slider, which affects the resulting file size and image quality.

3. **Comparison**: Users can compare the original image with the converted WebP image by clicking on the "Compare" button. This provides a visual representation of the difference in image quality and file size between the two formats.

4. **Download**: Users can download the converted WebP images individually or as a zip archive containing all the converted images.

### Code Overview

The provided JavaScript code includes several functions and event listeners to handle the image processing and rendering of the WebP images. Here's an overview of the main components:

1. **Upload Images**: The `convertImages` function is triggered when users select image files using the file input element. It processes the selected images, converts them to WebP, and updates the interface to display the original and converted images' file sizes.

2. **WebP Conversion**: The `processImage` function handles the actual conversion of each image to WebP format. It uses the HTML Canvas API to draw the image and then converts it to WebP using the `canvas.toBlob` method.

3. **Slider Value**: The `slider` element allows users to adjust the WebP conversion quality. The selected value is displayed beside the slider and controls the resulting WebP image quality.

4. **Render Webp Images**: The `renderWebpImages` function displays the converted WebP images, their file sizes, and comparison buttons for each image.

5. **Comparison Button**: The comparison button allows users to compare the original image with the converted WebP image side by side. Clicking the button displays the images in a popup.

6. **Download**: The `downloadImages` function handles the download process. Users can download either a single WebP image or a zip archive containing all converted images.

### Note

The provided code is intended as a starting point for the WebP Image Converter application. You may need to modify and adapt it to suit your specific use case and integrate it with your existing web application.

Ensure that you have the necessary libraries and components available for the application to function correctly. Additionally, consider adding error handling and validation to handle potential user input errors or server-side issues during image processing and downloads.
